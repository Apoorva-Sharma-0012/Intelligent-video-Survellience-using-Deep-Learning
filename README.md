# Intelligent-video-Survellience-using-Deep-Learning

A violence detection alert system's goal is to immediately identify and notify authorities or other relevant parties when violent incidents or hazardous situations arise. Such a system often makes use of a variety of technologies, including audio and video analysis, machine learning algorithms, and sensor networks, to identify and examine behavioral and action patterns that may be signs of impending violence.
This is our final year Major Project which we have made together to show that how deep learning can be implemented to detect that the violenece occured during the video or not.
