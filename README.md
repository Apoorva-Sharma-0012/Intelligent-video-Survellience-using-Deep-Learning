# Intelligent-video-Survellience-using-Deep-Learning
• Designed and implemented a deep learning-based model for video analysis as part of a final-year major project, achieving
accurate detection of violent events containing video footage.
• Applied a deep learning-based violence detection system using MobileNet V2, integrating the Telepot API for automated
alerts, enabling real-time identification and notification of violent incidents.
• Integrated the Telepot API with the violence detection system, allowing users to receive instant alerts on Telegram devices,
ensuring timely notifications of detected violent activities.
• Processed and transformed video datasets into smaller frames to optimize data preparation for deep learning model training.
